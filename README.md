# EKS-accessible-only-bastion

1. provider.tf â†’ AWS Provider Configuration
Purpose:

Specifies AWS as the cloud provider where all resources will be created.
Defines the region (us-east-1) where the infrastructure is deployed.
2. vpc.tf â†’ Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Purpose:

Creates an isolated network within AWS for hosting resources.
Defines the CIDR block (10.0.0.0/16), which represents the network range.
Enables DNS support for resolving hostnames within the VPC.
ðŸ“Œ Why do we need a VPC?

To segregate resources into private and public subnets.
To ensure security and controlled communication between components.
3. subnets.tf â†’ Public & Private Subnets
Purpose:

Public Subnet (10.0.1.0/24) â†’ Hosts the Bastion Host (which has internet access).
Private Subnet (10.0.2.0/24) â†’ Hosts the DB instance & EKS cluster (which should not be publicly accessible).
ðŸ“Œ Why do we need subnets?

Public subnet allows external access to the Bastion Host.
Private subnet isolates sensitive resources from the internet.
4. internet_gateway.tf â†’ Internet Gateway (IGW)
Purpose:

Enables public internet access for resources in the public subnet (Bastion Host).
Required to allow the Bastion Host to SSH into private instances.
ðŸ“Œ Why do we need an Internet Gateway?

Without it, public instances cannot connect to the internet for updates or remote access.
5. route_table.tf â†’ Routing Configuration
Purpose:

Defines how network traffic flows between public/private resources.
Public Route Table allows outbound traffic from the public subnet to the internet.
ðŸ“Œ Why do we need a Route Table?

Ensures proper communication between subnets, IGW, and external resources.
6. security_groups.tf â†’ Security Groups (Firewall Rules)
6.1. bastion_sg (Bastion Host Security Group)
Allows SSH (port 22) access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
Enables outbound traffic to the DB instance.
6.2. db_sg (Database Security Group)
Allows MySQL access (port 3306) only from Bastion Host.
Restricts direct access from the internet.
6.3. eks_sg (EKS Cluster Security Group)
Allows API server communication (port 443) only from Bastion Host.
ðŸ“Œ Why do we need Security Groups?

Ensures strict network access control between resources.
Prevents unauthorized access to the database & Kubernetes API.
7. instances.tf â†’ Compute Instances (EC2)
7.1. bastion (Bastion Host in Public Subnet)
Purpose:

Acts as a jump server to access resources in the private subnet.
Has a public IP and SSH access for secure administration.
7.2. db (Database Instance in Private Subnet)
Purpose:

Stores application data securely.
Does not have a public IP, so it cannot be accessed directly from the internet.
ðŸ“Œ Why do we need a Bastion Host?

Without it, there is no way to SSH into private resources like the DB instance.
8. eks.tf â†’ EKS Cluster Setup
Purpose:

Deploys an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Cluster in the private subnet.
Uses IAM role (eks_role) for AWS services interaction.
Uses EKS security group (eks_sg) to restrict API access.
ðŸ“Œ Why do we need an EKS cluster?

To run containerized workloads in Kubernetes.
Provides auto-scaling and self-healing for applications.
9. iam.tf â†’ IAM Role for EKS
Purpose:

Creates an IAM role (eks_role) with permissions for EKS to manage AWS resources.
ðŸ“Œ Why do we need IAM roles?

EKS needs permissions to provision networking & worker nodes.
Final Thoughts ðŸ’¡
This setup ensures security, scalability, and automation by:
âœ… Keeping EKS & DB in a private subnet (security-first approach).
âœ… Using a Bastion Host to securely access private instances.
âœ… Defining security groups to restrict access between components.
